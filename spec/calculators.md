# Clinical Calculators in GitEHR

## Goal

Provide a comprehensive, open-source library of clinical calculators with one canonical scoring engine driving every surface: the command line, an MCP server, the GitEHR desktop GUI, standalone single-file web tools, and a separately-distributable desktop/mobile app. Calculations are evidence-based, auditable, and - when run inside GitEHR - recorded automatically into the patient's version-controlled record with both inputs and results.

An EHR that ships a native, offline, auditable calculator suite driven by a single engine is something the "Big EHR" platforms structurally cannot produce, because it depends on a small-sharp-core architecture rather than a monolith. That is the advantage this spec is built to capture.

## Philosophy

### Open and free

- **Open source** - anyone can view, use, modify, and share the code (AGPL-3.0-or-later, matching GitEHR; clinical content under CC-BY-SA-4.0).
- **Free to use** - no paywalls, no licences, no restrictions.
- **Auditable** - scoring logic is pure and trivially readable; every calculator cites primary literature and is tested against known vectors.

### Soft interoperability

'Soft' interoperability is copy-and-paste interop. It empowers clinicians to use the tools they want without being constrained by their EHR, and lets them exercise their own judgement about whether to reach for a given calculator. Copy-and-paste is a common clinician workaround for the deficiencies of EHRs and is often derided as a kludge, but until real interoperability arrives we should embrace and optimise for the tools clinicians actually use. Every calculator therefore produces a clean, editable text summary for the clipboard as a first-class output, in addition to structured dispatch when embedded.

---

## Architecture: one core, many surfaces

The defining decision is a single scoring engine reused everywhere, so a result produced at the command line, in the browser, in the GUI, or via MCP is identical by construction. The dependency arrows all point **into** the core; the core never depends on anything above it.

### `calc-core` - the leaf engine

The single source of truth. Pure, deterministic scoring with no clock, no I/O, and no global state; a host that needs a timestamp stamps it when recording. It depends only on `serde` and `serde_json` - never on the rest of GitEHR and never on an async runtime. That leaf discipline is what makes the calculators detachable (see Distribution below).

Every calculator implements the `Calculator` trait and also exposes a strongly-typed `Input`/`compute` pair plus a `build_response` adapter. The crate-level registry (`all()` / `get(name)`) is the one list the CLI, MCP server, and GUI all enumerate, so adding a calculator surfaces it everywhere.

### `calc-cli` - the CLI surface (lib + bin)

All CLI behaviour lives in the library (`CalcCommand` + `run()`), so there is nothing to re-implement when embedding it. It ships two ways:

1. The standalone `calc` binary - `cargo install --git <repo> -p calc-cli` installs a small, dependency-light tool (tree: `anyhow`, `serde`/`serde_json`, `clap` - no tokio, no EHR).
2. The `gitehr calc` subcommand - the gitehr CLI depends on `calc-cli` and forwards to `calc_cli::run`, repeating nothing:

```rust
// cli/src/main.rs (planned)
#[derive(clap::Subcommand)]
enum Commands {
    // ...existing commands
    /// Clinical calculators
    Calc {
        #[command(subcommand)]
        command: calc_cli::CalcCommand,
        #[arg(long, value_enum, default_value_t = calc_cli::OutputFormat::Text)]
        format: calc_cli::OutputFormat,
    },
}
// ...
Commands::Calc { command, format } => calc_cli::run(command, format)?,
```

### MCP, GUI, and the standalone app

- **MCP** - `gitehr-mcp` exposes each calculator as a tool. The tool's input schema is `Calculator::input_schema()` and the tool body calls `Calculator::calculate(value)`. This is the most LLM-native surface: typed schemas handed directly to the model rather than scraped from help text.
- **GUI** - the Tauri app calls `calc_core` natively over a Tauri command (`calculate_clinical`) and writes the result to the journal, rather than reimplementing logic in the webview.
- **Standalone calc app** - a separate Tauri 2 app (own `productName`, bundle identifier, and icons; no gitehr branding required) for desktop and mobile. Because `calc-core` is pure Rust it cross-compiles to iOS/Android. The app's frontend is the `calc-web` HTML, backed by the Rust core over `invoke`, so standalone and embedded calculators give byte-identical results.

### Distribution and decoupling

The leaf discipline (nothing in `calc-core` depends on gitehr or tokio) is what enables both of these without trade-off:

- **Install just the calculators**: `cargo install --git <repo> -p calc-cli` (or publish `calc-core` + `calc-cli` to crates.io for `cargo install calc-cli`). Cargo builds only `calc-core` + `clap` + `serde`, never the EHR. The installed binary name is `calc` (set by `[[bin]] name`), independent of the package name.
- **Ship a non-gitehr app**: the standalone Tauri app path-depends on `calc-core` and is branded independently. It can live in this workspace (excluded, like `gui/src-tauri`) or its own repo depending on `calc-core` via git/crates.io.

The one rule that keeps this true: `calc-core` must stay a leaf. `gitehr -> calc-core`, never the reverse.

### Binary-size note

Adding the calculators to the `gitehr` binary costs almost nothing, because `gitehr` already links `clap`, `serde`, and `serde_json` - so the simple score-based calculators add no new dependencies, only a few KB of code and string data each. The only thing that moves the needle is calculators embedding large reference datasets (growth charts, risk-equation coefficient tables); for those, prefer loading tables from an embedded asset rather than baking everything into the binary's read-only data.

---

## Result schema: `CalculationResponse`

The Rust struct and the JSON object dispatched by the web bridge are the same shape, so results cross surfaces unchanged.

```rust
pub struct CalculationResponse {
    pub calculator: String,         // machine name, e.g. "feverpain"
    pub result: serde_json::Value,  // primary computed value (number or short string)
    pub interpretation: String,     // human-readable clinical interpretation
    pub working: serde_json::Map<String, serde_json::Value>, // step-by-step breakdown
    pub reference: String,          // primary citation / guideline
}
```

```json
{
  "calculator": "asrs",
  "result": 4,
  "interpretation": "Positive screen: 4/6 Part A items meet the frequency threshold...",
  "working": {
    "part_a_screen_result": "POSITIVE",
    "part_a_positive_item_count": 4,
    "part_a_total_score": 9,
    "part_b_total_score": 12,
    "total_score": 21
  },
  "reference": "Kessler RC et al. (2005). Psychol Med. 35(2):245-56."
}
```

When dispatched from the browser, an optional `patient_context` object is appended (echoed from the host's URL parameters). `CalculationResponse::to_summary_text()` produces a deterministic, timestamp-free clipboard summary; the recording host adds the timestamp.

---

## The `Calculator` trait

```rust
pub trait Calculator {
    fn name(&self) -> &'static str;          // stable machine name / subcommand / MCP tool name
    fn title(&self) -> &'static str;         // human title
    fn description(&self) -> &'static str;   // one-line description
    fn reference(&self) -> &'static str;     // primary citation
    fn license(&self) -> CalculatorLicense;  // algorithm distribution licence + evidence URL
    fn input_schema(&self) -> serde_json::Value;  // JSON Schema for inputs
    fn calculate(&self, input: &serde_json::Value) -> Result<CalculationResponse, CalcError>;
}
```

`license()` is a **required** method (see Licensing): every calculator must declare the terms its algorithm/content is distributed under, with a URL evidencing them, so the basis for shipping it is always on record.

`input_schema()` is the key LLM affordance: it powers `calc <name> --schema`, the fillable `calc <name>` template (derived from it via the `input_template()` default method), MCP tool definitions, and any agent that wants to discover the required inputs without parsing prose. Each calculator additionally exposes a typed `compute()` for ergonomic, compile-time-checked use from Rust.

---

## CLI design (LLM-friendly)

There are **no per-calculator flags**. Flags do not scale past the simplest scores (QRISK3 has ~20 mixed-type, enumerated, unit-bearing inputs) and would force a hand-written, drift-prone clap struct per calculator. Instead every calculator is driven through one regular, registry-backed surface - so a human or an LLM learns it once, and adding a calculator to `calc-core` gives it a working CLI for free:

```bash
calc list                       # list calculators (text or JSON via --format)
calc <name>                     # print a fillable INPUT TEMPLATE (JSON on stdout)
calc <name> --schema            # print the JSON Schema (the full input contract)
calc <name> --input -           # compute, reading JSON from stdin
calc <name> --input data.json   # compute, reading JSON from a file
calc <name> --input '{...}'     # compute, reading an inline JSON string
calc <name> --input ... --format json   # CalculationResponse as JSON on stdout
```

The template printed by `calc <name>` has the same shape as the input that `calc <name> --input` expects: each key carries a placeholder describing the expected value, derived from the schema so it can never drift from the contract. Fill in the placeholders and pass it back:

```bash
$ calc feverpain
{
  "fever": "<boolean> Fever in the last 24 hours",
  "purulence": "<boolean> Purulence (pus on the tonsils)",
  ...
}
# (a stderr hint explains how to pass it back; the catalogue uses `calc list`)

$ echo '{"fever":true,"purulence":true,"attend_rapidly":true,"inflamed_tonsils":false,"absence_of_cough":false}' \
    | calc feverpain --input - --format json
```

Conventions: the template/schema/compute outputs are pure JSON on **stdout**; usage hints go to **stderr** so they never corrupt a piped stream. Computing always requires an explicit `--input`, so a bare `calc <name>` is pure discovery and never blocks reading stdin. Invalid input is rejected by the calculator's own typed deserialization with a clear message and a non-zero exit. This mirrors the MCP surface exactly: there an LLM receives each calculator's `input_schema()` as the tool's `inputSchema` and passes back a JSON object - the same "here is the schema, give me the JSON" contract. Man pages and shell completions are generated from the clap definitions (clap_mangen / clap_complete; the gitehr CLI already uses clap_complete).

---

## Web frontend (`calc-web`)

The browser tools are single, self-contained HTML files: no build step, no framework, openable as a static file, embeddable, or hosted on GitHub Pages. The only permitted dependencies are the shared bridge module, the shared stylesheet, and optionally CDN-hosted CSS (which must degrade gracefully offline).

### Design principles

1. **Single file, no build step** - all markup, CSS, and JS inline or via CDN. (ES module imports of the shared bridge require serving over HTTP, which any static server satisfies.)
2. **Bespoke UI per calculator** - the layout suits the clinical purpose. A questionnaire looks like a questionnaire; a converter looks like a converter. Guided by clinical context, patient-facing vs clinician-facing use, cognitive load, and accessibility (keyboard navigable, screen-reader compatible, sufficient contrast).
3. **Logic** - today the web logic is plain inline JavaScript. The canonical logic now lives in `calc-core`; the web layer obtains it one of two ways: by calling the Rust core (in the Tauri app via `invoke`, or by loading `calc-core` compiled to WASM), or, for the pure no-build single-file case, by a JavaScript mirror that is validated against the shared `calc-core` test vectors. New calculators should treat `calc-core` as the source of truth and keep any JS mirror provably equivalent. For heavyweight statistical logic, Pyodide may run authoritative Python in the browser.

### The bridge (`shared/gitehr-bridge.js`)

A small ES module that makes each calculator context-aware without the author knowing the host environment.

| Context | Detection |
|---|---|
| Tauri (GitEHR desktop / standalone app) | `window.__TAURI__` present |
| iframe embed | `window.parent !== window` |
| Standalone | neither of the above |

Exported API: `sendResult(data)` (Tauri event `calculator-complete`; iframe `postMessage`; standalone no-op), `getPatientContext()` (reads URL query params injected by the host), `getContext()`, `saveButtonLabel()`, `formatClipboardText(data)`, `copyToClipboard(data)`.

### Result Card UI conventions (mandatory)

Every calculator renders a result card, in this order:

1. **Score summary and interpretation** - score tiles, a result badge (positive/negative/severity), and the interpretation string.
2. **Breakdown** (recommended) - a collapsible `<details>` block with per-item or per-criterion scores.
3. **Clipboard preview textarea** - an editable `<textarea>` pre-filled with the plain-text summary, shown before the action buttons. The copy button reads `previewTA.value` directly so clinician edits are preserved. Use `formatClipboardText()` for simple results or a bespoke `buildSummaryText()` for richer narratives (e.g. FeverPAIN).
4. **Action buttons** - rendered by JS after `getContext()`:

| Context | Primary | Always present |
|---|---|---|
| `tauri` | "Save to patient record" (`sendResult`) | "Copy result", "Start over" |
| `iframe` | "Send result" (`sendResult`) | "Copy result", "Start over" |
| `standalone` | - | "Copy result", "Start over" |

**Dynamic refresh**: any post-result selection that changes the clinical recommendation (prescribing strategy, dosing, follow-up) must update the textarea in real time. Store the last score/interpretation at module level and call `refreshPreview()` from every relevant change listener; clear them on "Start over".

---

## GitEHR integration

When a calculator runs inside GitEHR, dispatch stops being a bridge round-trip and becomes a direct call into the journal/state code.

### Journal entries

Results are recorded as immutable, timestamped journal entries with structured YAML frontmatter (calculator type, version, inputs, result, citation) followed by a human-readable Markdown body. This makes every calculation a permanent, auditable part of the record.

### State files

Latest results may also be written to `state/calculations/<name>-latest.json` for quick reference, including the inputs, result, who calculated it and when, and a pointer to the journal entry.

### Patient context

The host may append patient identifiers as URL parameters before opening a web calculator (`?patient_id=...&given_name=...`); `getPatientContext()` exposes them for labelling, pre-fill, and inclusion in the dispatched payload. The GUI path passes context directly.

---

## Authoring a new calculator

1. Implement it in `calc-core`: a typed `Input`, a pure `compute()`, a `build_response()` adapter, a `Calculator` impl with `input_schema()` and `license()` (the distribution licence plus an evidence URL), and unit tests against known vectors. Register it in `all()`. This is the **only** Rust work needed - the CLI (`calc <name>`, template, `--schema`, `--license`, `--input`) and the MCP tool are both driven generically from the registry, so there is no per-calculator CLI or MCP code to write.
2. (If a web tool is wanted) create `calc-web/calculators/<name>.html` following the Result Card conventions, with its JS logic validated against the `calc-core` vectors. Add a card to `calc-web/index.html`.
3. Add authoritative source material to `calc-web/clinical-source-references/`.

See `skills/build-calculator/` for the detailed authoring workflow.

---

## Clinical validation

Each calculator must include: a primary peer-reviewed citation; evidence of clinical utility; test cases with known inputs/outputs from the literature (encoded as unit tests in `calc-core`); documented limitations and contraindications; and a process for incorporating guideline changes.

---

## Licensing

- `calc-core` / `calc-cli`: AGPL-3.0-or-later (consistent with GitEHR).
- Clinical algorithms: implement from primary literature; most scores are public-domain methods. Do not copy proprietary implementations (e.g. MDCalc).
- RCPCH growth charts: confirm licensing terms with RCPCH before distribution.
- All calculators cite original publications and validation studies.

### Per-calculator distribution licence (required)

Distinct from the code licence (AGPL-3.0), every calculator must record the terms under which its **clinical algorithm or content** is distributed, plus a URL evidencing those terms, so the basis for shipping each calculator is on record and can be re-verified at any time. This is enforced in code, not by convention:

- The `Calculator` trait requires `fn license(&self) -> CalculatorLicense`, where `CalculatorLicense { license, source_url }` carries the terms (an SPDX id where one applies, otherwise a short description such as "Public domain - no permission required") and a reverifiable URL. A calculator that omits it does not compile.
- A registry test (`every_calculator_records_its_license`) asserts every registered calculator has a non-empty licence and an `http(s)` source URL, so a new calculator cannot ship without recording its basis.
- The licence is surfaced for evidencing via `gitehr calc <name> --license` and in `gitehr calc list --format json` (`license`, `license_source`). When calculator results are recorded into the journal (a later phase), the licence should travel with the recorded result as provenance.

Most scores are pure published methods (algorithms are generally not subject to copyright), implemented from the primary literature and citing the publication as their source. Some instruments carry an explicit grant: PHQ-9 and GAD-7 are public domain (Pfizer, 2010); the ASRS is copyright WHO / NYU / Harvard and free to use with citation. Where terms are proprietary or unclear (e.g. FRAX), the calculator is not shipped until the basis is established.

---

## Open questions

- Unit conversion support (metric/imperial)?
- Queryable calculation history (`gitehr calc history`)?
- Printable reports for results in the GUI?
- FHIR Observation export for standardized exchange?
- User-defined / third-party calculators via a plugin system?

## Future enhancements

Calculator plugins; fetching guideline updates from a registry; multi-step decision trees beyond simple scores; auto-populating inputs from current patient state; trending results over time; high-risk-score alerts.

---

This specification establishes GitEHR as a comprehensive clinical decision support tool with auditable, version-controlled calculation results, driven by a single engine that is equally at home in the EHR, at the command line, in an LLM's toolset, and as a standalone app.
